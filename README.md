# Assignment 0 â€“ Web Technology

Welcome to Assignment 0 of the Web Technology course.  
Your task is to create a simple HTML file and submit it using Git.

## Task

1. **Create a file named `webpage.html`** in the root of the repository.
2. Inside `webpage.html`, add a valid HTML5 document that contains:
   - A `<h1>` heading with the text **Hello World**.
   - Any additional content you like, but the `<h1>` is required.
3. **commit** and **push** your solution to Github (using the command line or a  Git Client, not the web interface)

Example file content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
